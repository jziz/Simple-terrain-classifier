<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a simple image classifier I built for an engineering project. The classifier is a Google MobileNet adapted to classify three types of terrain, namely asphalt, dirt and grass. 
The main script "Classification_pi.py" is supposed to be run on a raspberry pi using a PiCamera. The Pi was to be fitted on a mobile robot and identify the type of terrain it was moving on in order to choose the most appropriate speed profile.
Another version of the script used another pretrained model imported via ONNX (Classification_ONNX.py).
